# NN Fashion Classification

This project focuses on classifying images of clothing into 10 different categories using Neural Networks. The classification is performed using the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items.

## Project Overview

The NN Fashion Classification project aims to build a robust classification model for clothing items using deep learning techniques. The project is divided into three parts:

### Part 1: Implement Neural Network using NumPy

In this section, a simple neural network is implemented from scratch using NumPy. The focus is on understanding the core mechanics of neural networks, including forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.

### Part 2: Implement Neural Network in PyTorch

This part involves using PyTorch to create a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset. PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph simplifies the implementation and provides a more flexible framework for building complex models.

### Part 3: Implement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

In this final part, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented in PyTorch to improve classification accuracy by leveraging spatial hierarchies in images.
